## Reporting a Vulnerability

If someone has uploaded any kind of malware, masked as a .cpp or .exe or file of any extention. That file  should be immidiately reported. __You can report a Vulnerability__ by __forking__, __cloning__ this repository, then __deleting the malware files locally__ from the repository, then __committing__ and __pushing changes__ to forked repository and then __creating a pull request__, which states the changes and their ___cause___ or ___purpose___ to the _master_ repository.

Vulnerabilities are'nt a usual thing here, but they will be reviewed within a less than a week normally, or within a month if I'm away(and if anyone responsible for moderating this repository is away too).
